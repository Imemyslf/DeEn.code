# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kishan! 


## Welcome to my Ki's-Cryption Project.  

### Overview:

Ki's-cryption is a simple Python program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text messages. It is designed to be user-friendly and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of interaction.

### Features:

1. User-Friendly Interface: Ki's-cryption offers a clean and user-friendly GUI built using the custom tkinter library (CTk).

2. Encryption and Decryption: Users can both encrypt and decrypt text messages using the program. The encryption process involves shifting characters in the input text and introducing random characters to enhance security.

3. Placeholder Text: The program offers placeholder text in both the "Decrypted message" and "Encrypted message" text boxes. Users can input their text for encryption and decryption.

## How to Use:

Run the DeEn_gui.exe file to open the GUI.

Input the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the respective text boxes.

Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the text or the "Decrypt" button to decrypt it.

The program will display the result in the corresponding text box.

## Requirements:

Python 3.x (Latest Version)

customtkinter (CTk) library
